# Face Detection using OpenCV
A simple face detection program using OpenCV's CascadeClassifier.

## Prerequisites
- OpenCV installed
- HaarCascade model file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)

## Usage
The program captures video from the default camera and detects faces in each frame. Detected faces are displayed in a window with a green rectangle around them. The program ends when the 'q' key is pressed.

## Notes
- The scaling factor can be adjusted for faster or slower face detection.
- The HaarCascade model file path should be updated to the location on your machine.
